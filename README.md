# Book Excerpts

This project was created in order to interest visitors with various excerpts from books of different genres and writers.

If you don't know which book to choose, try the randomizer. At the bottom of each publication the author, the title of the book and the chapter from which the excerpt is taken are marked so you can easily find it. If you have already read this work, just repeat the action.

You may even get inspiration and ideas for your own stories.
